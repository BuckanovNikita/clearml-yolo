"""Significance tests for per-class metric deltas between a baseline and a candidate model.

Every delta is ``candidate - baseline``, so a positive delta is an improvement and a
negative one a degradation. Every test is two-sided: the p-value answers "did this class
change at all", the sign of ``delta`` answers "in which direction". Benjamini-Hochberg
then controls the false discovery rate over that two-sided family, and the direction of
each surviving change is still read off the sign of its delta.

One hypothesis gets exactly one p-value. Recall's comes from :func:`mcnemar_recall` and
precision's from :func:`bootstrap_precision_delta`; :func:`bootstrap_recall_delta`
supplies recall's confidence interval only and deliberately returns a NaN p-value, so
the recall hypothesis cannot be counted twice in the Benjamini-Hochberg family.
